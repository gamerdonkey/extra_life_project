Extra Life Game Voting System
-----------------------------

ALternatively known as some of the worst Python code I've written since picking up on the language.

I'm just trying to make myself play some more games and possibly garner some more donations.
The Python scrapes my [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/) donation page for comments formatted like 'vote <game>'. It then inserts the games and donations into an Sqlite3 database to be compiled and displayed via more ugly code (PHP this time).
